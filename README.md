##The task is to create a **Text Summarization Tool** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This tool takes a long article or paragraph as input and gives a short and meaningful summary as output. It helps people quickly understand the main points without reading the whole text. The tool uses a method called **extractive summarization**, which picks the most important sentences from the original text. We used a Python library called **sumy**, which includes the **LexRank algorithm** to do this. The tool is easy to use, works offline, and runs in Visual Studio Code. It does not need a big internet download or any complex setup. This project shows how NLP can be used in a simple way to save time and make reading easier.
